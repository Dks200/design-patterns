# Design Patterns

### Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of clients that use it.

### Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object (aka the "subject" or "observable" or “publisher”) maintains a list of dependents (called "observers") and automatically notifies them whenever there is a change in its state. The pattern also allows addition and removal of observers at runtime.

### Decorator Pattern
Decorator pattern allows you to add new functionality to objects dynamically without altering their original structure.
